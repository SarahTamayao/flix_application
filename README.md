### Notes
The only big challenge I encountered was downloading CocoaPods. When entering the command "pod init", it gave me an error saying I do have that command built in. Therefore, I asked my fellows for help. She gave all the instructions of what I need to download. There were lots of missing commands. After a few rvm/gnup commands I had to download, there was an error message on my terminal that my fellow did not understand. It was getting too complicated to have ruby installed. Furthermore, my ruby version was 2.3 and I needed 2.5 or above. Nothing worked to install a new version. Therefore, my fellow said I should just submit without the CocoaPods and having the images on the movie posters. I really wished I could complete the whole thing, but unpredictable issues happened.
